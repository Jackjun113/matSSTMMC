# Abstract
A Solid State Transformer (SST) consists of a
high-frequency transformer and power electronic converters.It
is relatively a complex system. It requires control in many
stages. The control methods vary from topology to topology.
In this paper, Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) topology
is used in converter stage. To control MMC, a hybrid control
is implemented consisting of a modified sorting algorithm and
model predictive control. Using the proposed algorithm, the
performance of the system under different grid disturbances has
been analyzed.
